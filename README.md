# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this webpage as a study guide for the prework associated with the University of Minnesota's Coding Boot Camp class. This project is designed to help students learn the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Throughout the process of making this webpage I learned about each of them.
